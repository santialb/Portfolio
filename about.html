            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Hello! I'm Santiago Albarracin, a dedicated and passionate backend developer with a strong foundation in Java and Spring Boot. I have a broad understanding of software development, having worked on various projects in C#, Kotlin, and Python. My approach to development is rooted in curiosity and creativity, which drives me to continuously explore new technologies and improve my skills.</p>

            <p>I am highly proficient in both English and Spanish, with a good command of basic French, which enables me to communicate effectively in diverse environments. Problem-solving is at the core of my work, and I find joy in tackling complex challenges, whether it’s debugging code or optimizing a system’s performance. Over time, I have demonstrated strong logical reasoning and an ability to think critically, skills that I continually sharpen through hands-on experience and self-directed learning.</p>

            <p>Outside of development, I love traveling and exploring new places and cultures. I believe that my exposure to diverse environments fuels my creativity and helps me bring fresh perspectives to my work. My curiosity pushes me to stay up-to-date with the latest industry trends, and I enjoy applying innovative solutions to both everyday problems and the larger tasks at hand.</p>

            <p>In addition to my technical expertise, I have a deep commitment to continuous improvement. I'm excited about the opportunities ahead, where I can contribute to impactful projects and collaborate with like-minded professionals who share my enthusiasm for building robust and scalable solutions.</p>
